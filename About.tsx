          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            LinkedLeaders was founded by Mike Caldwell in 2024 in response to seeing droves of school leaders burned out and leaving the profession. At its core, LinkedLeaders is about relationships and investing in professional connections. In a world that is centered on the advancement of technology and artificial intelligence, LinkedLeaders centers on Human Connection.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Our mission is to empower K-12 school leaders to create meaningful, lasting impacts in their schools and communities through personalized, peer-to-peer support.

          </div>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            One could argue that there isn't a more complex, challenging and exhausting line of work than that of a school leader. LinkedLeaders is a lifeline of sorts for those leaders in the trenches today. Through our community, we offer more than just encouragement, support, mentoring and coaching, we offer hope in a job that can seem hopeless. We believe that through our efforts, great leaders will stay in the profession longer, good leaders will become great and new and inexperienced leaders will have the support they need to have a long and rewarding career in school leadership.
